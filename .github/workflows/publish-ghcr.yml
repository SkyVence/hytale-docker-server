# Publish Docker image to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
#
# - Builds a multi-arch image using buildx
# - Pushes a commit-SHA-tagged image on every push
# - When pushing to `main`, retags/pushes `:latest`
# - When pushing a Git tag (refs/tags/*), also retags/pushes that tag
#
# The workflow uses the built-in GITHUB_TOKEN for authentication. Ensure the
# workflow has `packages: write` permission (set below). If you prefer to use a
# Personal Access Token (PAT) instead, add it as the `CR_PAT` secret and replace
# `password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` with `password: ${{ secrets.CR_PAT }}`.
